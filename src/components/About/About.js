            <p>
            Privately owned public space (POPS), 
            or alternatively, privately owned public open spaces (POPOS), 
            are terms used to describe a type of public space that, 
            although privately owned, is legally required to be open 
            to the public under a city's zoning ordinance or other land-use law. 
            The acronym POPOS is preferentially used over POPS on the west coast of the US. 
            Both terms can be used to represent either a singular or plural space or spaces. 
            These spaces are usually the product of a deal between cities 
            and private real estate developers in which cities grant valuable 
            zoning concessions and developers provide in return privately owned public 
            spaces in or near their buildings. Privately owned public spaces commonly 
            include plazas, arcades, small parks, and atriums. Many cities worldwide, 
            including Auckland, New York City, San Francisco, Dublin, Seattle, Seoul, and Toronto, 
            have privately owned public spaces. Some cities and advocacy groups have created 
            websites about these spaces.
